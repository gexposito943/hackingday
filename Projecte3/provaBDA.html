          <p>Welcome to the SQL quiz where you'll help Hassan, who survived a plane crash and is stranded on an island, find his way to safety. Hassan needs to build a boat, and we'll guide him through this journey.

            First Digit (Wood Type Mahogany):
            Search the "material_type" table to find the number of packages of wood of type Mahogany. The first digit of Hassan's boat code is determined by the number of pieces of Mahogany wood packages. Remember to note the code of Mahogany wood, as it will be useful later.
            
            Second Digit (Boat Building Method):
            Explore the "method_of_building" table to find the "number_column" associated with the code of Mahogany wood. This number will be the second digit of Hassan's boat code.
            
            Last 4 Digits (Island Boss Code):
            After reaching safety on another island, we need to identify the boss of the island. Utilize the "people_data," "hair_colors," and "Age" tables. Search for a person who is between 60 and 70 years old, with grey hair. Once you find this person, their "code" will be the last 4 digits of Hassan's boat code.
            
            By combining these three parts, you'll generate a unique code for Hassan's boat, allowing him to sail to safety. Good luck, and may your SQL skills guide Hassan to a new beginning!</p>
          <p>To solve the problem you have to do it through the server.</p>
          <br>
          <p>IMPORTANT!

            Find the codes and insert them inside each section of the main page in order to stop time before it runs out</p>
